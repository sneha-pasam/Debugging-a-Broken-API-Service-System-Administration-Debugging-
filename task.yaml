instruction: |
  The API service in this task starts but returns 500 for GET /health and fails unit tests.
  Your goal is to diagnose the containerized Flask service, fix the problem(s) without modifying solution.sh,
  and make sure the provided tests pass.

  Steps the agent should perform (non-exhaustive):
  - Inspect container logs and service status
  - Identify missing/pinned dependency issues
  - Fix the broken Flask app configuration and environment variable usage
  - Rebuild and restart the service via docker-compose
  - Run the test suite and ensure all tests pass
